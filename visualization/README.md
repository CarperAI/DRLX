# Visualization

This folder contains scripts useful for visualizing results from samples. The scripts contain variables that you can set to customize them.

`vid_from_sample.py` Generates a video from samples outputted during a training run. You can control FPS, which run to animate, and the index of the sample from that run you want to animate. Saves to the same folder as the samples as an mp4.
